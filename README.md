# HTML Minimal Email Signature Template

A simple, flat and minimalistic HTML email signature compatible with most email clients. While not responsive in the usual sense, it adapts nicely to any screen down to 400px width. It can be easily converted to a full *Email Template* customizing the `<div id="cont">` section, the aim of this repo is to improve and optimize the `<div id="sig">` section though.

Created for use in **Thunderbird** with the help of the fine **Stationery** extension. But it should be usable with any email client or editor that supports HTML.

### Example

2. Mail App on OS X 10.11.2
3. Gmail browser app on Windows 7 Chrome

**Please help reporting compatibility with composers and clients**

### Known Bugs

- Gmail App on Android 5.0 overrides  `<td style="white-space:nowrap;">` on portrait mode in a FHD screen.

### TO DO
- [ ] Explore a simple and reliable option to make the cells stack on small screens.
