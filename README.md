# HTML-Signature-Boilerplate

![HTML signature Boilerplate Template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ioCreativo/HTML-Signature-Boilerplate/master/teaser.png "Raw image @ 1:1 Scale")

A simple HTML email signature boilerplate compatible with most email clients. While not responsive in the usual sense, it adapts nicely to any screen down to 400px width.

Created for use in **Thunderbird** with the help of the fine **Stationery** extension. But it should be usable with any email client or editor that supports HTML.

### Tested/Working On

1. Thunderbird 38+ on Windows 7
2. Mail App on OS X 10.11.2
3. Gmail browser app on Windows 7 Chrome

**Please help reporting compatibility with composers and clients**

### Known Bugs

- Gmail App on Android 5.0 overrides  `<body style="margin:0">` 
- Gmail App on Android 5.0 overrides  `<td style="white-space:nowrap;">` on portrait mode in a FHD screen.

### TO DO
- [ ] Explore a simple and reliable option to make the cells stack on small screens.
- [ ] Test and report composing / viewing issues. Thanks
